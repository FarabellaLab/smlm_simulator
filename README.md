# smlm_simulator


A simulator for Single Molelecule Localization Microscopy data.

Function simulate() generates a simulated experiment starting from predefined segment paths (which can be obtained e.g. with getChr21DLs) and following the specified parameters.

In examples/ you can find examples on how to use the simulator

The disposition of probe localizations and false localizaions is based on https://github.com/JeremyPike/RSMLM (Pike, J. A., Khan, A. O., Pallini, C., Thomas, S. G., Mund, M., Ries, J., ... & Styles, I. B. (2020). Topological data analysis quantifies biological nano-structure from single molecule localization microscopy. Bioinformatics, 36(5), 1614-1621.)
